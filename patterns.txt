Star Pattern Challenge: Alternating Pyramid

Write a program that prints an alternating pyramid pattern where odd-numbered rows contain asterisks (*) and even-numbered rows contain hash symbols (#). The program should take a positive integer \(n\) as input, representing the number of rows.

### Input
- A single positive integer n (where n>=3)

### Output
An alternating pyramid pattern where:
- Odd rows (1st, 3rd, 5th...) use asterisks (*)
- Even rows (2nd, 4th, 6th...) use hash symbols (#)
- Each row is centered with appropriate spacing
- Row i contains 2i - 1 symbols

### Example

**Input:** 5

**Output:**
```
    *
   ###
  *****
 #######
*********
```

**Input:** 7


```
      *
     ###
    *****
   #######
  *********
 ###########
*************
```

### Constraints
- \(3 <= n <= 50\)
- If n < 3, print "Invalid input"


- Calculate leading spaces for each row: n - i spaces for row i
- Number of symbols in row i:2i-1
- Use modulo operator to determine whether to print * or #







Nested Loops Challenge: Prime Number Grid
Write a program that generates an 
m
×
n
m×n grid where each cell contains either the product of its row and column indices if the product is a prime number, or 0 if it's not prime.

Input
Two positive integers: 
m
m (number of rows) and 
n
n (number of columns)

Output
An 
m
×
n
m×n grid where:

Each cell at position (i, j) contains 
i
×
j
i×j if the product is prime

Each cell contains 0 if the product is not prime or equals 1

Use 1-based indexing (rows and columns start from 1)

Each number should be right-aligned in a 4-character wide field

Example
Input: m = 5, n = 6

Output:

text
   0    2    3    0    5    0
   2    0    0    0    0    0
   3    0    0    0    0    0
   0    0    0    0    0    0
   5    0    0    0    0    0
Explanation:

Cell (1,2): 1×2 = 2 (prime) → display 2

Cell (1,3): 1×3 = 3 (prime) → display 3

Cell (2,2): 2×2 = 4 (not prime) → display 0

Cell (3,4): 3×4 = 12 (not prime) → display 0

Input: m = 4, n = 4

Output:

text
   0    2    3    0
   2    0    0    0
   3    0    0    0
   0    0    0    0

Implement a helper function to check if a number is prime

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself

Hints
Use nested loops: outer loop for rows, inner loop for columns

Create a separate function isPrime(num) to check primality

For formatting, use appropriate string formatting functions
