​Problem Statement
Write a JavaScript function that takes a number n as input and prints a hollow diamond where:
The borders display row numbers instead of stars\
The interior is hollow (spaces only)
Numbers are placed at the first and last position of each row

For n = 6, the output should look like:
     1
    2 2
   3   3
  4     4
 5       5
6         6
 5       5
  4     4
   3   3
    2 2
     1
Constraints
Input n should be greater than 1
Use nested loops with conditional logic
Handle spacing and hollow interior correctly
